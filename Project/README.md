matminer is a Python library for data mining the properties of materials.

Matminer contains routines for 40+ datasets (described [here](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/dataset_summary.html))

The datasets available by loading the following modules:

- load_boltztrap_mp()
- load_brgoch_superhard_training()
- load_castelli_perovskites()
- load_citrine_thermal_conductivity()
- load_dielectric_constant()
- load_double_perovskites_gap()
- load_double_perovskites_gap_lumo()
- load_elastic_tensor()
- load_expt_formation_enthalpy()
- load_expt_gap()
- load_flla()
- load_glass_binary()
- load_glass_ternary_hipt()
- load_glass_ternary_landolt()
- load_heusler_magnetic()
- load_jarvis_dft_2d()
- load_jarvis_dft_3d()
- load_jarvis_ml_dft_training()
- load_m2ax()
- load_mp()
- load_phonon_dielectric_mp()
- load_piezoelectric_tensor()
- load_steel_strength()
- load_wolverton_oxides()



## Task:
1. Choose a suitable material property.
2. Investigate what features are important to describe it. 
3. Build a model with as few variables as possible that describe the property you selected.
4. Predict/optimize the property at hand... here you must have an "imaginary" application for the property you have choosen. Try to figure out a case where you want a certain value for the proerty at hand.


In the report, I want to see how you set up the workflow (from data aqcuisition to sharing the results) for solving the problem. Try to write an introduction from a materials science point of view.
